# 🌸 Wasserfall im Blütenmeer

(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ **What is this???**  
This is *Wasserfall im Blütenmeer* — an aesthetically confused yet emotionally stable server monitoring tool handcrafted by **Team Andreas**.  
It’s soft. It’s observant. It stares into your server’s soul... so you don’t have to.

Do we know why it’s called that?  
No. But it’s beautiful, okay?

---

## 🌧️ Why though?

Let’s be honest. Most monitoring tools are:

- 🚫 Loud  
- 🚫 Boring  
- 🚫 Judgy when your RAM hits 98%

So we built *Wasserfall im Blütenmeer* instead:  
A tool that watches, logs, and occasionally panics – **gently**.  
It's like if a cherry blossom had a dashboard.

## 🌼 Philosophy (yes, really)

> “Monitor everything. Panic gracefully. Restart with dignity.”  
> — *Unknown sysadmin, probably crying*

Wasserfall im Blütenmeer doesn't just measure your system.  
It feels it. Deeply. 💫

## 💫 What does it actually do? (Besides vibe)

- 👀 Watches your server metrics like a concerned forest spirit  
- 📜 Writes logs in a way that says, “I care, but I’m not mad”  
- 🌸 Sends alerts with the emotional weight of a 90s anime outro  
- 🤖 Runs on technologies we definitely Googled first

It might even do something useful. We think.
